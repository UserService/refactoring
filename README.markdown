Java Refactoring Test Project
=============================

**Please, before starting the test read these instructions carefully.**

Introduction
------------

This is a refactoring testing project used by H2RD hiring process.

The idea of this exercise is to evaluate your ability to identify poor coding practices and improve the code through the use of best practices.

The main project is a very basic user management application. We are not looking to add any supplementary features, instead we are verifying the following:

* Your knowledge of REST.
* Your knowledge of Maven.
* Your ability to identify and refactor poor Java code.
* Your ability to identify and fix bugs.
* Your ability to apply proven design principles.
* Your ability to write useful and effective tests.

Feel free to modify whatever you want! :)

Pre-reqs
--------

* The first thing you need is to have a bitbucket account. If you don't have it yet, you can create it on [bitbucket website][2].

* This repo uses Mercurial as SCM. If you don't have it you need to install it on your machine. You can choose between installing a [command line version][3] or a [graphical tool][4] to manage it.

* To build this project you must install Maven. If you do not have it installed, please refer to the [maven website][1] for assistance.

* For deployment you can use any web container/application server you want. We used tomcat version 7.0.26 to validate if the application was starting up correctly.

Instructions
------------

1. Fork this repo using the bitbucket website.
1. Clone your new forked repo from bitbucket.
1. At the project root directory, run:
    `$ mvn package`
1. At this point the maven build should run successfully and every test should be green.
1. Perform the refactoring you deem necessary, following what you know to be the best practices. (feel free to innovate!).
1. At the end of your work you should push the code to your forked repo but you should **NOT** do a pull request.
1. The final step is to send an email to your contact at the company informing him/her that you finished the test and the username you used on bitbucket.

Good luck!
